**Introduction**

This case study is taken as Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
Cyclistic is a bicycle-share company based in Chicago, USA. They started a startup in 2016 to provide cycles on rent for people ease and daily use , now it has become a company. Since then, the startup has grown to a fleet of 5,800icycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 600tations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
In this case study I am working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic.
Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day

**Business Task**

Cyclistic’s marketing strategy was focusing on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships made the startup successful. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have highlighted that casual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno, the marketing director, realized that instead of growing more customers we should focus on converting casual riders to members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Data Analyst needs to be working for Cyclistic in the marketing analytics team by following the six stages of the Data Analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act to result in a structure that makes decision-making and problem-solving easier.
